# vsbtools

`vsbtools` is a Python research toolbox for building, transforming, and
analyzing crystal-structure datasets. Its dataset tools live in
`vsbtools/materials_tools/materials_dataset`.

## Overview

`CrystalEntry` represents one structure plus its id, optional energy, formula,
and metadata. `CrystalDataset` is a read-oriented collection of entries with
dataset metadata, a cached `elements` property derived from entry compositions,
`merge()` and `filter()` helpers, and parent/child tracking for processed
stages. Datasets also keep track of the directory used for their
`manifest.yaml`, `data.csv`, and `POSCARS.zip` files.

The package can:

- store datasets as `manifest.yaml`/`data.csv`/`POSCARS.zip` bundles, the
  package's native on-disk format;
- import structures from collections of individual POSCAR files, multi-image
  POSCARS, CIF collections, and extended XYZ files (`.extxyz`);
- export datasets as POSCAR collections or multi-image POSCARS;
- filter pathological structures by density, cell geometry, and minimum
  interatomic distance;
- analyze and enforce crystallographic symmetry, including space-group labels,
  symmetry-operation counts, nonequivalent-site counts, primitive standard
  structures, and refined structures;
- poll and cache reference structures from OPTIMADE providers, Alexandria,
  OQMD, Materials Project, and local structure/energy files;
- merge generated datasets with reference datasets and mark reproduced
  reference structures;
- estimate energies and relax structures through registered ML backends such as
  MatterSim and GRACE;
- build phase diagrams, compute formation energies and energy above hull, and
  filter structures by hull distance;
- compare structures with DScribe/USPEX-style fingerprints, detect structures
  already present in a reference set, cluster duplicates, and keep best
  representatives;
- access descriptors used for guidance losses in `scout-matter`;
- collect summary tables, generation statistics, histograms, KDE plots, Pareto
  fronts, and reproducibility artifacts.

## Tutorial

The `Doc` directory contains a worked tutorial for common dataset operations:

- `vsbtools/materials_tools/materials_dataset/Doc/Crystal_Dataset_Use_Cases.ipynb`
- `vsbtools/materials_tools/materials_dataset/Doc/Crystal_Dataset_Use_Cases.md`

The notebook is the source version; the Markdown file is a rendered copy for
quick reading. It walks through loading generated structures, polling reference
databases, cleaning, deduplication, symmetrization, energy and hull analysis,
dataset persistence, reporting, Pareto-front examples, and multi-dataset
descriptor plots.

## Scenario Workflows

`analysis/scenario_pipeline.py` runs YAML/JSON-defined workflows as a directed
acyclic graph of stages. Registered operations include raw parsing, density and
minimum-distance filtering, symmetrization, database polling, reference merging,
energy estimation, relaxation, hull filtering, and deduplication.

Reference database polling prefers OPTIMADE by default. Other supported sources
include local Alexandria JSON exports, local OQMD MySQL deployments, and
Materials Project through its API.

Database caches use the platform's per-user cache location and are created only
when data is written:

- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\vsbtools\Cache\DB_caches`
- macOS: `~/Library/Caches/vsbtools/DB_caches`
- Linux/Unix: `${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/vsbtools/DB_caches`

Set `VSBTOOLS_CACHE_DIR` to override the `vsbtools` cache root on any platform.

## MatterGen Postprocessing

One important packaged use case is postprocessing MatterGen outputs, especially
guided generations produced by the `scout-matter` fork. The provided workflow
preserves generation metadata and uses it to analyze guidance-loss
distributions, target-property distributions, structural descriptors, Pareto
fronts, and reproducibility metrics.

A packaged reproducibility pipeline is provided for the MatterGen guidance
analysis workflow. It starts from the raw-generation archives in
`Examples/raw_generations`, postprocesses them into staged datasets, builds
summary/Pareto artifacts, plots descriptor distributions, and writes a run
manifest.

```text
vsbtools/materials_tools/materials_dataset/Examples/
├── README_reproducibility.md
├── setup_reproducibility_envs.sh
└── mg_generation_postprocessing_pipeline.ipynb
```

The setup script creates a contained workspace with three virtual environments:
`vsbtools`, `scout-matter`/MatterGen, and GRACE/`tensorpotential`. Notebook
outputs are written to a separate run directory.

```bash
bash vsbtools/materials_tools/materials_dataset/Examples/setup_reproducibility_envs.sh \
  --root ./vsbtools_reproducibility_env \
  --run-root ./vsbtools_reproducibility_run
```

See `Examples/README_reproducibility.md` for manual configuration, pinned
commit/tag setup, and launch instructions.

## Python Scenario Example

```python
from pathlib import Path
from vsbtools.materials_tools.materials_dataset.analysis.scenario_pipeline import ScenarioPipeline
from vsbtools.materials_tools.materials_dataset.io import write

pipeline = ScenarioPipeline.from_file(Path("scenario.yaml"))
pipeline.ctx.globals["elements"] = ["Si", "O"]
pipeline.ctx.toolkit_options["structure_parser"]["root"] = Path("input_structures")

for stage_name, dataset in pipeline.run():
    write(dataset, enforce_base_path=Path("processed") / stage_name)
```

## Installation

Python 3.10 or newer is required.

```bash
python3 -m pip install -e .
python3 -m pip install -e ".[materials_tools]"
```

Additional external requirements depend on the workflow:

| Workflow | External dependency |
| --- | --- |
| Optional legacy `USPEXBridge` similarity backend | Python USPEX package/installation importable as `USPEX`. |
| Database polling | Materials Project credentials and/or Alexandria/OQMD access. |
| ML energy estimation | MatterSim and/or GRACE environment. |
| Diffusion guidance analysis | MatterGen importability via `MATTERGEN_PYTHON_PATH` or host-specific configuration. |
| Packaged reproducibility notebook | Use `Examples/setup_reproducibility_envs.sh` to create contained `vsbtools`, `scout-matter`, and GRACE environments. |

External tools mentioned above:

- MatterGen is a crystal generative model; `scout-matter` is the MatterGen fork
  used by the guidance workflow (<https://github.com/link-lab3629/scout-matter>).
- MatterSim and GRACE are ML interatomic-potential/energy-estimation backends;
  GRACE is accessed through `tensorpotential`.
- USPEX is an evolutionary crystal-structure-prediction code. `materials_dataset`
  retains a legacy-compatible structural fingerprint and optional bridge where
  needed for dataset deduplication.

## Running Tests

There is no single project test runner configured. The repository contains
`unittest`-style tests under `materials_tools/materials_dataset` subdirectories.

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s vsbtools/materials_tools/materials_dataset -t . -p "*_Test.py"
python3 -m unittest discover -s vsbtools/materials_tools/materials_dataset -t . -p "*_test.py"
```

Many tests require optional dependencies or local sample data.

## Development Notes

- Prefer the active `materials_tools.materials_dataset` API for new dataset-processing code.
- Many scripts assume an editable install with the repository root on `PYTHONPATH`.
- Generated artifacts such as `manifest.yaml`, `data.csv`, `POSCARS.zip`, cached database files, plots, and summary tables are expected outputs of normal workflows.
